# SwedishNumbers
A coding challange to implement some checks for swedish social security and organisation numbers.
The program takes a peronnummer, sammordningsnummer or organisationsnummer as input and
prints which checks has failed. So in the case of a personnummer it will say that
it is not an organisationsnummer and not a sammordningsnummer.

## How to build & run
On windows use run.cmd\
On linux/osx use run.sh
